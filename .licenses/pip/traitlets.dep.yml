Each contributor maintains copyright\nover their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these\ncontributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython\nsource code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or\ninstitution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython\nDevelopment Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what\nchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate\ntheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the\nchange to one of the IPython repositories.\n\nWith this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file\nto indicate the copyright and license terms:\n\n    # Copyright (c) IPython Development Team.\n    # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.\n"
